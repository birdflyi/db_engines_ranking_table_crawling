Each document is decomposed into separate columns — each column tailored to a specific data type with its own dedicated logic for storage and processing. Data integrity is enforced through document schemas that define the expected structure within each collection. This architecture allows every field in a document to function like an index, enabling exceptional query performance. If you're already familiar with MongoDB or other popular NoSQL databases, onboarding with Diana DB will be easy — its query language is conceptually close to MongoDB's MQL.",,1.4.6,,,,,,nan,nan
